## Send integer datas with CC3200-LAUNCHPAD to Thingspeak.
This project uses CC3200-LAUNCHXL board. After intialization and wifi AP connection, a TCP socket is etablished with Thingspeak service.
Then every minute, the device send two datas using GET method.
Thingspeak Field1 receive onboard TMP006 temperature in Â°C.

#define CC_SSID_LEN_MAX       32
#define CC_BSSID_LEN_MAX      6

in app_cloud.c, update your Thingspeak API key.
